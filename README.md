# Academic Performance and Civic Engagement
After the most recent presidential election, many find themselves wondering how voter turnout can be improved among the younger population of voting age. How can we improve young adult civic engagement through the education system? It is vital to investigate the factors that influence voter turnout like the rate of droupouts, chronic absences, and High school completion. Our findings showed that the number of empowered yooung voters increased as the absenteeism and dropout rates decreased. 
 

# Why is this a Challenge/Problem?
What do you remember when you think of the 2016 election results? Regardless of which side etc. Were you surprised / what kind of emotions did you feel? For many, shock was the predominant emotion they felt in the wake of Trump’s election. Many had expected that Clinton would inevitably win, but poor voter turnout in key states may have helped Trump win the election. Consequently, we are interested in investigating the factors that influence voter turnout. If high numbers of young voters do not show up to vote, our elected leadership will poorly reflect the wants and needs of the population of this country.

In 2016, voter turnout was 49.6% for midterm elections, 60.9% for the presidential. For young people 18-24 in midterm elections in 2018, the turnout was 35.8%. 
Almost 92 million eligible Americans did not vote in the 2016 presidential elections
Young people are considered the most important and influential people in elections. How can we get them to vote?

# Our Solution
Dear Teachers and Legislators, help kids stay in school! Actions that schools can take include

-Track attendance to identify students at risk of becoming chronically absent

-Set milestones towards graduation to discourage dropping out 

-For high priority schools/CSAs, investigate factors resulting in high dropout or chronic absence rates 

Business Answer: We should focus on reducing rates of chronic absenteeism and dropping out to boost voter turnout as well as prioritize areas with high absences and low voter turnout similar to Patterson Park, N & E.

We want to encourage

-A positive environment/reinforcement

-Student government elections

-Exposure to current events and civic engagement

-An environment to question/discuss beliefs


Possible explanations for low voter tunrout:

-Schools/CSAs with high dropout or chronic absence rates may result in students missing key explanations on why civic engagement is important.

-Systemic inequities in these CSAs (socioeconomic / demographic) may be responsible for both high absence and dropout rates and low voter participation


So, Which education system metrics should we target to increase voter turnout?
Which Baltimore County areas should we prioritize our efforts towards?

Chronic absence and dropping out are significant predictors of lower voter turnout. 
Each 10% increase in HS dropouts is correlated with a 16% decrease in voter turnout.
Each 10% increase in chronic absenteeism is correlated with a 5% decrease in voter turnout.

“Which Baltimore County areas should we prioritize our efforts towards?”

Areas similar to Patterson Park, N E are part of a cluster of CSAs with the highest chronic absence and dropout rates and lowest voter turnouts.


# Future Suggestions
In the future we need to 

-Obtain more recent datasets and perform analysis on year-over-year trends to see if the pattern is consistent
-Seek more complete datasets (including Baltimore City)
-Examine relationship with voter registration
-Examine demographic and socioeconomic factors characteristic of the high priority CSAs
-Try different numbers of clusters in research


Now that you told us what needs to happen for your problem as a result of your analysis, how does this come into play in the next 6 months? Year? Ten years? What would you recommend happens in this industry/situation from an organizational, policy, leadership, or some other type of shift or pivot? Why is the future brighter based on this change and why should people care about this? This is similar to a conclusion, but also gives a clear call-to-action to the designated group/people who can do something about your original business question. This section should be about one paragraph.

## Additional Notes and Useful Links:
### Exploring your business question
I suggest picking a business question that’s related to Baltimore City, Baltimore City Government as a “business,” or another city government that you may be familiar with as a “business” since most major cities have well-populated open data portals, however, if you wish to explore a different business question, and you can find enough valid data to help you explore this topic, then you may pursue that topic. Here are some resources that might help you explore civic issues in Baltimore City and related resources:

### Data Analysis
While you don’t (and shouldn’t) list out the entirety of your data analysis in your executive summary, you’ll need to upload your excel/Python/other data analysis work to your GitHub profile for a complete project. You don’t need to write up an explanation for each document you upload, but it should be clear what kind of analysis you conducted, why you chose this type of analysis, and your findings from each analysis uploaded. You can also upload data analysis that didn’t directly contribute to your business answer and suggestions to provide a robust background on your research. It should be clear to anyone in the class who isn’t in your group how you came to your data conclusions. 

### GitHub Issues and Projects
Utilize the GitHub Issues and Project feature to track your progress, collaborate with your team, and keep accounts of different resources and findings throughout your project. You can read more about submitting issues [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue), [here](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), and [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-issues).

### Executive Summaries
This write-up is similar to a business plan executive summary if your “service” is your business solution. While there are sentence/paragraph suggestions in each section, try to keep the written part of your executive summary to less than 2 pages typed in a Word document. Here are some good resources on business plans to learn more about why they’re important and how you should approach writing them:
