# Academic Performance and Civic Engagement
After the most recent presidential election, many find themselves wondering how voter turnout can be improved among the younger population of voting age. How can we improve young adult civic engagement through the education system? It is vital to investigate the factors that influence voter turnout like the rate of droupouts, chronic absences, and High school completion. Our findings showed that the number of empowered yooung voters increased as the absenteeism and dropout rates decreased. 
 

# Why is this a Challenge/Problem?
What do you remember when you think of the 2016 election results? Regardless of which side etc. Were you surprised / what kind of emotions did you feel? For many, shock was the predominant emotion they felt in the wake of Trump’s election. Many had expected that Clinton would inevitably win, but poor voter turnout in key states may have helped Trump win the election. Consequently, we are interested in investigating the factors that influence voter turnout. If high numbers of young voters do not show up to vote, our elected leadership will poorly reflect the wants and needs of the population of this country.

# Our Solution
What’s your business answer and how did you come to this conclusion from your data analysis? What is the impact of your findings? Tell your reader up front what you found, and then support your findings with summary statements about and links to your analysis that you’ve uploaded to your GitHub repository. In some cases, you won’t be able to “solve” the business question because this is related to a larger systemic challenge or something that relies on many outside forces to solve. That’s okay--explain why this might be the case, and use your data analysis to support these statements. Interpret your methods in big-picture analysis, simple linear regression, correlation, multiple linear regression, and clustering into words that a general audience can understand, and relate these findings back to your original business question. [Clear data visualizations](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and data tables can easily help point out trends, outliers, and distributions. Initially you told us why we should care about the problem, now tell us what you, an industry, company, group, demographic, or the reader can do about it based on your analysis. Be specific about your business answer, but don’t get lost in the details. Instead of saying “the trend shows that there is a problem with employment,” specifically point out the decline/increase or use a data visualization to specifically point out problem points. However, don’t get too specific in providing context for your analysis--the audience might want to point out specific significant variables from a linear regression model, but you don’t need to post a screenshot of the result of your full analysis table or list out the prediction equation or exact p-values for each variable. This section is the “meat” of your executive summary, but this shouldn’t be longer than a couple paragraphs.

# Future Suggestions
Now that you told us what needs to happen for your problem as a result of your analysis, how does this come into play in the next 6 months? Year? Ten years? What would you recommend happens in this industry/situation from an organizational, policy, leadership, or some other type of shift or pivot? Why is the future brighter based on this change and why should people care about this? This is similar to a conclusion, but also gives a clear call-to-action to the designated group/people who can do something about your original business question. This section should be about one paragraph.

## Additional Notes and Useful Links:
### Exploring your business question
I suggest picking a business question that’s related to Baltimore City, Baltimore City Government as a “business,” or another city government that you may be familiar with as a “business” since most major cities have well-populated open data portals, however, if you wish to explore a different business question, and you can find enough valid data to help you explore this topic, then you may pursue that topic. Here are some resources that might help you explore civic issues in Baltimore City and related resources: 
 - [_The Baltimore Sun_](https://www.baltimoresun.com/)
 - [_Baltimore Magazine_](https://www.baltimoremagazine.com/)

### Data Analysis
While you don’t (and shouldn’t) list out the entirety of your data analysis in your executive summary, you’ll need to upload your excel/Python/other data analysis work to your GitHub profile for a complete project. You don’t need to write up an explanation for each document you upload, but it should be clear what kind of analysis you conducted, why you chose this type of analysis, and your findings from each analysis uploaded. You can also upload data analysis that didn’t directly contribute to your business answer and suggestions to provide a robust background on your research. It should be clear to anyone in the class who isn’t in your group how you came to your data conclusions. 

### GitHub Issues and Projects
Utilize the GitHub Issues and Project feature to track your progress, collaborate with your team, and keep accounts of different resources and findings throughout your project. You can read more about submitting issues [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue), [here](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), and [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-issues).

### Executive Summaries
This write-up is similar to a business plan executive summary if your “service” is your business solution. While there are sentence/paragraph suggestions in each section, try to keep the written part of your executive summary to less than 2 pages typed in a Word document. Here are some good resources on business plans to learn more about why they’re important and how you should approach writing them:
