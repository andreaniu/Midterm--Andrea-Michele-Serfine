# The Impact of Baltimore County Education Systems on Voter Turnout
By Andrea Niu, Michele Lan, and Serfine Okeyo

Trump’s unexpected 2016 election victory revealed what a crucial role voter turnout plays in shaping the democratic future of the United States. Many wondered how we could improve voter turnout among younger voters. Multiple studies ([source](http://ftp.iza.org/dp6539.pdf)) have established that education positively impacts voter turnout, so it is vital to investigate:
* **what aspect(s) of Baltimore County's education systems we should target to improve voter turnout**, and
* **which school districts in Baltimore require the most resources to increase voter turnout**, so that we can prioritize resources for them. 

Our findings showed that:
* **voter turnout increased as chronic absence and dropout rates decreased** and,
* **areas with similar characteristics to Patterson Park N&E require the most resources to increase turnout**. 


In the future, these findings will allow us to:
* **prioritize funding allocation for specific school districts in Baltimore**, and 
* **predict voting trends based on absence and dropout rates**.

# Why is this a Challenge/Problem?
What do you remember when you think of the 2016 election? For many, shock was the predominant emotion they felt in the wake of Trump’s election. Many expected that Clinton would inevitably win, but poor voter turnout in key states may have helped Trump win the election. Consequently, we are interested in investigating the factors that influence voter turnout. Hence, this business question is an important issue to consider because *if high numbers of young voters do not show up to vote, the elected representatives of the Baltimore area and the entire U.S. will poorly reflect the wants and needs of its younger residents*. 

Voter turnout in the United States is consistently lower than other developed nations, ranking at about 26 out of 32 OECD nations ([source](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/)). Almost 92 million eligible Americans did not vote in the 2016 presidential elections, which represents almost an entire third of the total US population ([source](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2018/07/11/453319/increasing-voter-participation-america/)). Furthermore, for young people aged 18-24, the 2018 midterm elections only had a turnout of 35.8% ([source](https://www.fairvote.org/voter_turnout#voter_turnout_101)).
Young people are an important and influential demographic in elections. Furthermore, young voters represent a demographic that is more diverse in terms of race, sexual orientation, religion, and gender than older generations. Consequently, neglecting to encourage young voter participation may result in the election of representatives who fail to support the interests of young voters, and allow the passage of exclusive government policies that further systemic inequities. 

Hence, encouraging young people's participation in the United States democracy through elections is essential. Since education has been proven to correlate with increased civic engagement ([source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00400.x)), we will examine what educational metrics we can target to promote higher voter turnout.

**Datasets Used:**
[Civic engagement](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Neighborhoods/Neighborhood-Action-Sense-of-Community-2010/ipje-efsv)
 vs. [the education metrics of Baltimore County students](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Neighborhoods/Education-and-Youth-2010-2013-/f9ua-ivaj)



# Our Solution
Possible explanations for low voter tunrout:



-Schools/CSAs with high dropout or chronic absence rates may result in students missing key explanations on why civic engagement is important.

-Systemic inequities in these CSAs (socioeconomic / demographic) may be responsible for both high absence and dropout rates and low voter participation


So, Which education system metrics should we target to increase voter turnout?
Which Baltimore County areas should we prioritize our efforts towards?

Chronic absence and dropping out are significant predictors of lower voter turnout. 
Each 10% increase in HS dropouts is correlated with a 16% decrease in voter turnout.
Each 10% increase in chronic absenteeism is correlated with a 5% decrease in voter turnout.

“Which Baltimore County areas should we prioritize our efforts towards?”

Areas similar to Patterson Park, N&E are part of a cluster of CSAs with the highest chronic absence and dropout rates and lowest voter turnouts.


# Future Suggestions

We should focus on reducing rates of chronic absenteeism and dropouts to boost voter turnout, and also prioritize areas with high absences and low voter turnout similar to Patterson Park, N & E.

What steps can we take to achieve this? 
To Teachers and School Administrators: help kids stay in school! Actions that schools can take include:
* Tracking attendance to identify students at risk of becoming chronically absent, then **meeting/calling their guardians** to discuss the importance of consistent attendance. This plan can be implemented relatively quickly, and could also be a way to hear from guardians about factors such as home life, socioeconomic situations, or transportation, which may be the cause of chronic absences or dropping out.
* Setting **milestones towards graduation** to discourage dropping out and **partnering with college-readiness nonprofits** to offer students counseling or resources that will support their journey to graduation,
* For high priority schools/CSAs, **interview students** to investigate factors resulting in dropouts or chronic absences. This action can be implemented quickly (within 6 months), and can help each school decide what actions to take to reduce these rates.

To legislators and Board of Education members: 
* Policy Changes: **Set goals for school districts** to reduce their absence and dropout rates to a certain level. This may be a longer term goal that takes multiple years for schools to achieve, but defining a target goal in the first place is an important step to take. 
* **Prioritize funding and resources** for schools with the highest dropout and absence rates. Generally, annual Board of Education budgets allocate a certain sum of money towards strategic initiatives aimed at improving the quality of the education system, which allows schools to try out riskier pilot programs without having to take money out from the funding for their normal operating expenses. Setting 'chronic absence and dropout reduction' as one possible strategic initiative and including it in the budget is one way to incentivize schools to work towards that goal.

Following through with these actions will motivate schools to understand what situations may lead to chronic absence or dropout rates. As schools become more engaged and communicative with students and families about the importance of attendance, there may be a reduction in dropout and absence rates, which will increase the exposure students get to civic education and politically engaged peers/teachers, thus positively influencing voter turnout. In turn, this may result in better representation of young voters in Baltimore County and the election of representatives whose policies align with the younger population, and consequently increase their sense of political agency and civic satisfaction.
